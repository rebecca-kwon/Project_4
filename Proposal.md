- application_test.csv
- application_train.csv
- bureau.csv
- bureau_balance.csv
- credit_card_balance.csv
- installments_payments.csv
- previous_application.csv

## Objective

Using the application train and test datasets, we will predict on credit risk. Additionally, we will explore predictions for loan  balances.  
Run model on whether or not a loan is defaulted -- What factors help predict this outcome? 
Which factors predict balances on the loan 

Using provided train/test data vs creating own train,test,split data
